Birtish North America;Great Britain continued establishing in North America, and gained territories grouped in what is now called British North America. This group includes the Floridas, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Rupert’s Land, Saint John’s Island. After the loss of the thirteen colonies after United States independance in 1776, there are the british possessions in 1850.
British West Indies;Great Britain has also settled in what is now called British West Indies, in the Carribeans, and has taken possession of several islands such as Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Anguilla or Jamaica, which gave it an important option on the commercial exchanges in the Atlantic ocean. In the same area, Great Britain also conquered Guyana during that period.
First steps on Africa, Asia and Oceania;In the same time, Great Britain extended their domination by settling in new territories, such as South Africa, the Indian coast and the Autralian coast, The map shows you the territories hold by Great Britain in Africa, Asia and Oceania in 1822.

Great Britain also won militarly territories such as New Guinea. 
Progressive decolonisation;After 1919, the territory of the British Empire kept dicreasing. First, the statute of Westminster was set up and allowed several colonies to become independant.
