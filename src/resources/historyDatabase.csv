The British Colonial Empire throughout history;This part allows you to see a presentation of the dynamics of construction of the Bristish Colonial Empire, understand how it was for a moment the most powerful entity in the world, often at the cost of wars, and see the remains of it after progressive decolonization.
The beginning;At the beginning of the XVIIth century, British colonization started from a settlement in North America. You can see on the map the thirteen colonies that then gave birth to the United States of America. The first colony to be founded was that of Virginia in 1607 and the last one was Georgia in 1732.
Birtish North America;Great Britain continued establishing colonies in North America and gained territories they organized in a group we now call British North America. This group included the Floridas, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Rupert’s Land, Saint John’s Island. After the loss of the thirteen colonies through the United States of America independence claim in 1776, these are the last possession of the British Crown.
British West Indies;Great Britain also settled in what is now called the British West Indies, in the Carribeans, and has taken possession of several regions such as Guyana, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Anguilla or Jamaica, which gave it an important weight for trade in the Atlantic ocean and the Carribean sea.
First steps on Africa, Asia and Oceania;During the same period, Great Britain extended their domination by settling in new territories, such as South Africa, the Indian coast and the Autralian coast, The map shows the territories held by Great Britain in Africa, Asia and Oceania in 1822.
Constant expansion;From that moment, and until the first world war, Great Britain has kept on conquerong territories, often with huge conflicts, including the rivalry with France in Africa. In 1914, they held the entire Canada, India and Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, and a huge part of Africa composed of Egypt, Sudan, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe , Nigeria or Kenya.
Peak of the Empire;The British Colonial Empire reached its peak in 1919, by winning german former colonies including Namibia and Tanzania in Africa, and Ottoman territories including Irak and Jordania in the Arabian Peninsula after the First World War. Great Britain also won militarily territories such as New Guinea. 
Progressive decolonization;After 1919, the territory of the British Empire kept dicreasing. First, the Statute of Westminster was set up and allowed several colonies to become independent. This Act was signed by some of the most important colonies of Great Britain, such as the Irish Free State in 1922 (ratified in 1919), Canada in 1931, South Africa and Newfoundland in 1934, Australia in 1942 and New Zealand in 1947.
Second World War;After the defeat of Italy during the Second World War, in 1945, Great Britain claimed two of the former Italian colonies: Libya and Eritrea (blue on the map). These were the last colonies to join the British Empire.
Decolonization in Asia and Oceania;Right after the Second World War, and after multiple negociations and protests, Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip became independent in 1946, followed by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (1947), Sri Lanka and Burma (Myanmar, 1948) and later Malaysia (1957), Cyprus (1960), Koweit (1961), South Yemen (1967),  Qatar, Bahrein, Oman and the Arabic United Emirates (1971), New Guinea (1975) Solomon Islands (1978).
Massive decolonization in Africa;Following the Second World War, Great Britain underwent an important wave of independence movements throughout its empire. This period is called « Wind of Change » in Africa. These losses include Egypt (1953), Sudan (1956), Ghana (1957), Nigeria, Somalia and Eritrea (1960), Sierra Leone (1961), Uganda (1962), Kenya (1963), Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Malta (1964), Zimbabwe and Gambia (1965), Botswana and Lesotho (1966) and Swaziland (1968).

Those regions are  Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica (1962), Guyana and Barbados (1966), the Bahamas (1973), Grenada (1974), Dominica (1978), Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1979), Belize and Antigua & Barbuda (1981), Saint Kitts and Nevis (1983).

Indeed, in 1898, China and Great Britain signed an emphyteusis that transfered power over Hong Kong from China to Great Britain. This rental agreement was decided to be 99 years long. Consequently, in 1997, Hong Kong was returned to China. This retrocession was an internationally followed event with the noticeable presence of Prince Charles.

The main countries of this organization are South Africa, Canada, India and Australia.
