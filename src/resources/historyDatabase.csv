Birtish North America;Great Britain continued establishing in North America, and gained territories grouped in what is now called British North America. This group includes the Floridas, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Rupert’s Land, Saint John’s Island. After the loss of the thirteen colonies after United States independance in 1776, there are the british possessions in 1850.
British West Indies;Great Britain has also settled in what is now called British West Indies, in the Carribeans, and has taken possession of several islands such as Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Anguilla or Jamaica, which gave it an important option on the commercial exchanges in the Atlantic ocean.
